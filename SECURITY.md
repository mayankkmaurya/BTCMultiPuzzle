# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in the pool or client software, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Contact us privately via [Telegram](https://t.me/btcmultipuzzle)
3. Provide details about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for us to address it before public disclosure

## Client Security

The mining client:
- ✅ Only communicates with our pool server (72.60.71.15)
- ✅ Does not access your filesystem beyond its own directory
- ✅ Does not store your private keys (only your public BTC address)
- ✅ Uses standard CUDA libraries for GPU computation

## Your Responsibility

- Keep your Bitcoin receiving address secure
- Don't share your nickname if you want privacy
- Download clients only from official sources:
  - [btcmultipuzzle.com](https://btcmultipuzzle.com/join/#download)
  - This GitHub repository

## Verifying Downloads

Always download from official sources. If in doubt, ask in our [Telegram group](https://t.me/btcmultipuzzle).
